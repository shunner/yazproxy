About the proxy
---------------

For the proxy the actual target is determined in by the OtherInfo
part of the InitRequest. We've defined an OID for this which we call
PROXY. The OID is 1.2.840.10003.10.1000.81.1. 

  OtherInformation   ::= [201] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE{
    category           [1]   IMPLICIT InfoCategory OPTIONAL, 
    information        CHOICE{
      characterInfo            [2]  IMPLICIT InternationalString,
      binaryInfo               [3]  IMPLICIT OCTET STRING,
      externallyDefinedInfo    [4]  IMPLICIT EXTERNAL,
      oid                      [5]  IMPLICIT OBJECT IDENTIFIER}}
--
  InfoCategory ::= SEQUENCE{
      categoryTypeId   [1]   IMPLICIT OBJECT IDENTIFIER OPTIONAL,
      categoryValue    [2]   IMPLICIT INTEGER}

The InfoCategory is present with categoryTypeId set to the PROXY OID
and categoryValue set to 1. The information in OtherInformation uses
characterInfo to represent the target using the form target[:port][/db].

For clients that don't set the PROXY OtherInformation, a default
target can be specified using option -t for proxy.

Example:
  We start the proxy so that it listens on port 9000. The default
  target is Bell Labs Library unless it is overridden by a client in
  the InitRequest.

     $ ./yaz-proxy -t z3950.bell-labs.com/books @:9000

  The client is started and talks to the proxy without specifying
  a target. Hence this client will talk to the Bell Labs server.

     $ ./yaz-client localhost:9000

  The client is started and it specifies the actual target itself.

     $ ./yaz-client -p localhost:9000 bagel.indexdata.dk/gils

  For ZAP the equivalent would be
     proxy=localhost:9000
     target=bagel.indexdata.dk/gils
  Simple, huh!
